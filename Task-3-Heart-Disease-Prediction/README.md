# Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has heart disease based on health-related features.

## Dataset
Heart Disease UCI Dataset  
Source: Kaggle (johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the heart disease dataset
- Performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualized class distribution and feature correlations
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC
- Analyzed feature importance using model coefficients

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
- The Logistic Regression model achieved good accuracy on the test data
- The confusion matrix showed effective classification of both classes
- The ROC curve indicated performance better than random guessing
- Features such as age and cholesterol had a strong influence on predictions

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data loading and exploration to model training and evaluation, using a real-world healthcare dataset.
