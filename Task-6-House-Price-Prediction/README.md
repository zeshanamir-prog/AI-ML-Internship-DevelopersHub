# Task 6: House Price Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this task is to predict house prices using property features such as
location coordinates, number of rooms, and median income.

## Dataset
California Housing Dataset  
Source: Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron (GitHub)

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the housing dataset
- Handled missing values in the dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated the model using MAE and RMSE
- Visualized actual vs predicted house prices

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
- The model was able to predict house prices with reasonable error
- Median income showed a strong relationship with house prices
- MAE and RMSE indicate acceptable baseline performance

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates a complete regression workflow for predicting house prices
using real-world housing data.
